I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct configuration and imports set up, but the styles just wouldn't render. The issue was intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently. I checked browser developer tools and the classes seemed to be applied (present in the 'class' attribute) yet the corresponding styles from my Tailwind configuration were not being applied. Other times it worked as expected.
